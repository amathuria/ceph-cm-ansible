container-host
==============

The container-host role will:

- Install ``docker`` or ``podman``
- Configure a local ``docker.io`` mirror if configured

Variables
+++++++++

``container_packages: []`` is the list of container packages to install.  We default to podman on RedHat based distros and docker.io on Debian-based distros.

The following variables are used to optionally configure a docker.io mirror CA certificate. The role will install the certificate in both ``/etc/containers/certs.d`` (for podman) and ``/etc/docker/certs.d`` (for docker).::

    # Defined in all.yml in secrets repo
    container_mirror: docker-mirror.front.sepia.ceph.com:5000

    # Defined in all.yml in secrets repo
    container_mirror_cert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Tags

registries-conf-ctl
    Add ``--skip-tags registries-conf-ctl`` to your ``ansible-playbook`` command if you don't want to use registries-conf-ctl_ to configure the container service's conf file.

packages
    Just install the packages.

cert
    Just put the container mirror cert in place.  Does **not** restart ``docker`` daemon.  Intended to let the role be idempotent but not disruptive in case ``docker`` processes are running.
